# 🔍 CAI Recon Sentinel

**An autonomous, AI-powered recon agent built with [Alias Robotics' CAI Framework](https://github.com/aliasrobotics/cai)**  
Perform passive reconnaissance tasks using AI agents that reason, act, and log results—perfect for red team recon, security research, and CTF warm-ups.

## 🧠 About the Project

Recon Sentinel uses the agentic capabilities of the CAI Framework to intelligently conduct multiple types of passive recon:
- WHOIS lookups
- Shodan scans
- Subdomain enumeration

Each task is isolated, reusable, and transparently logged with Human-in-the-Loop support. It's modular, easily extendable, and deployable on a local machine using free-tier APIs and open-source tools.
